# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel fairly confident, although I am still struggling with the concepts of arguments. I'd like to keep working on that more so I have a better grasp.

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I feel confident in writing simple methods, however I had a very difficult time with passing multiple arguments through a method.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
Can you establish a custom method forever? Like with the other "pre-made" methods here, and essentially have your own library?
